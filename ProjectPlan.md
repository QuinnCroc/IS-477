# Exploring the Connection Between Housing Costs and Crime Rates in U.S Cities

## Overview
This project studies how the cost of houses relates to public safety across different U.S cities. This project includes datasets on housing market costs and crime statistics. This project’s main goal is to understand if higher housing costs correlate with lower crime rates, or if other socioeconomic factors influence this relationship. This project will study patterns in different cities to identify trends in housing markets and crime categories. The datasets provided have data from 2012 to the present, and all of these datasets will be cleaned and merged to form reasonable connections between cities and prices. The results formed from this project can provide understanding into where people choose to live and how different areas change over time. The project has multiple modules discussed in class, including ethical data use, transparency, and reproducibility. These modules have helped my team produce reliable connections on house affordability and safety in the United States.

## Research Question(s)
This project focuses on understanding the relationship between public safety and housing affordability across different U.S cities. 

This topic brings us to our first research question:
**1.** How do housing prices relate to crime rates across different cities?



Our second question goes more in-depth, and it asks:
**2.** Do cities with higher housing costs consistently experience lower violence or crime rates among property?




Our third research question takes more of an investigative approach, and it asks: 
**3.** How have housing prices and crime rates changed from 2012 until now? Are these trends different by region or size?


These questions allow us to study how affordability and safety affect different communities across the United States. The results of these questions will help people choose where they live according to social patterns in this data.

## Team
This project is a collaboration between Quinn Crockling and Krishan Amin. Our team will work closely on the data lifecycle for accuracy, organization, and reproducibility. Krishan will focus on cleaning the data, data acquisition, and integrating the data. Krishan will ensure that both of our datasets are cleaned thoroughly and ready to be merged for analysis. Quinn will focus on exploring the data and creating data visualizations that will help uncover patterns between the cost of houses and crime rates. Together, we will focus on interpreting what the results of our research mean.

## Datasets
This project uses two datasets that explore the relationship between housing costs and crime rates in U.S cities. We pulled the first dataset from Kaggle, and it is titled “US Cities Housing Market Data - Live Dataset.” This dataset gives information on the monthly housing market from 2012 to the present. Variables like median sale price, listing price, price per square foot, and homes sold are included in this dataset. This dataset allows us to make ideas by providing other aspects, like where these houses are located. The second dataset is also from Kaggle, and it is titled “United States Crime Rates By City Population.” This dataset includes crime statistics for different cities that have different populations. This dataset measures features like crime, property crime, burglary, robbery, and assault. Both of these datasets allow us to compare housing prices and crime rates in any city. Once cleaning is performed, the datasets will be merged to reveal patterns and relationships for public safety and housing across the United States.

## Timeline
To ensure we stay organized and work in a timely manner we will implement a timeline for our project. We will first begin by collecting our data. We do this by finding, downloading, and comparing the data sets that we have selected. Next, we will ensure that the timeline includes information from 2012 to the present to ensure relevance. Next, Krishan will perform data cleaning by fixing missing values, making city names and other data consistent, and checking for other inconsistencies. After that, Krishan will combine both datasets into one table that we can use for analysis. Then Quinn will analyze the combined table using summary statistics, charts, and graphs to see what patterns he can find between housing prices and crime rates. After that, he will continue building models, such as a regression analysis, to determine whether there is any real connection between the two variables. Finally, we will work together to analyze, conclude, and present our findings by using visuals and creating a final report. Our timeline may be adjusted depending on which parts end up taking the most time; however, this basic timeline ensures that each step will get enough time and attention.

## Constraints
We want to get clear results, but some problems could affect our project. One problem is missing data because some cities do not report crime every year. Another problem is timing. Housing data is often updated more than once a year, while crime data is usually updated once. It is also hard to match the data when city names or boundaries are not the same in both datasets. Some other factors, such as income, education, and employment may influence both housing prices and crime, but we may not have that data. Because of this, our results may not fully explain the connection between housing and crime.

## Gaps
Some parts of our plan still need to be completed as we move forward. One problem is how to define a city in the data because some datasets list only the city, and others include the metro area. We also need to adjust crime numbers using population to compare towns of different sizes. Another missing part is data about income, work, and living costs. This data could show why housing and crime change together. If time allows, we will look for another dataset that includes this information. We must also choose which math methods to use when testing whether housing and crime are connected or just changing at the same time. By knowing these problems early, we can make a clear study that shows how housing and crime relate across the United States cities.
